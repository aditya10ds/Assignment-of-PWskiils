    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated themselves but serve as a basis for defining concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used to implement abstraction and to define interfaces in Python. It allows you to define abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete subclasses. Abstract base classes are useful when you want to define a common interface that multiple classes should adhere to, ensuring consistent behavior and providing a clear contract for interacting with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key features and uses of the abc module:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): The abc module provides the ABC class and the abstractmethod decorator, which are used to define abstract base classes. An abstract base class is created by subclassing ABC and using the abstractmethod decorator on the methods that must be implemented by the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing Method Implementation: By defining abstract methods in an abstract base class, you can ensure that any concrete subclass that inherits from the ABC must implement those methods. If a subclass fails to implement any abstract method, a TypeError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism and Interface Definition: Abstract base classes provide a way to define common interfaces that multiple classes can adhere to. This promotes polymorphism, where different objects can be treated as instances of the abstract base class, enabling code reuse and modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type Checking: The abc module can be used for type checking. By using ABCs as type hints in function signatures or variable annotations, you can indicate that a parameter or variable should be an instance of a particular abstract base class or its subclass. This helps in maintaining type consistency and catching type-related errors."

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects: By defining classes and creating objects, you can encapsulate data and behavior together. The attributes of a class represent the data, and the methods represent the behavior or operations that can be performed on that data. By controlling access to the attributes through methods, you can hide the internal details and provide a simplified interface for interacting with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifiers: Python provides access modifiers such as public, protected, and private, although the convention is to use naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility. By using naming conventions like a single underscore (_) or double underscore (__) prefix, you can indicate the intended visibility of attributes and methods. This helps in abstracting the implementation details and exposing only the necessary information to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getters and Setters: By defining getter and setter methods, you can control the access and modification of attributes. Getter methods provide read-only access to the attributes, allowing the retrieval of their values. Setter methods, on the other hand, provide a controlled way to modify the attribute values, allowing you to enforce any required validation or logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties: Python's property decorator allows you to define special methods, known as getter, setter, and deleter methods, which can be used to define properties on a class. Properties abstract the access and modification of attributes, providing a natural and convenient way to interact with the data.\n",
