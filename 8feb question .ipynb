    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated themselves but serve as a basis for defining concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used to implement abstraction and to define interfaces in Python. It allows you to define abstract methods that must be implemented by concrete subclasses. Abstract base classes are useful when you want to define a common interface that multiple classes should adhere to, ensuring consistent behavior and providing a clear contract for interacting with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key features and uses of the abc module:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): The abc module provides the ABC class and the abstractmethod decorator, which are used to define abstract base classes. An abstract base class is created by subclassing ABC and using the abstractmethod decorator on the methods that must be implemented by the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing Method Implementation: By defining abstract methods in an abstract base class, you can ensure that any concrete subclass that inherits from the ABC must implement those methods. If a subclass fails to implement any abstract method, a TypeError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism and Interface Definition: Abstract base classes provide a way to define common interfaces that multiple classes can adhere to. This promotes polymorphism, where different objects can be treated as instances of the abstract base class, enabling code reuse and modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type Checking: The abc module can be used for type checking. By using ABCs as type hints in function signatures or variable annotations, you can indicate that a parameter or variable should be an instance of a particular abstract base class or its subclass. This helps in maintaining type consistency and catching type-related errors."
